Random-Python-Tests
===================

These are random tests I have done that help me to learn and understand different ways
of doing things with the various languages I am working with.

Some of them may not work and others are just plain stupid but they all serve a purpose
and that purpose is to teach me something new.

**Side note: Most of my Python is written for Python 3.2. so if you are having issues
such as "invalid syntax" at print statements, it is possible you are using Python 2.7
instead of 3.2 to run it.**
